# ESP (Express, Share, Post)

---

## What's this?

ESP is a simple social media platform built with [Deno](https://deno.land/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## But there's lots of Social Media, why another one?

We're building ESP to avoid the clutter of other Social Media websites.

It's build to be simple, fast and easy to use, all while keeping a Minimal feeling to it.
